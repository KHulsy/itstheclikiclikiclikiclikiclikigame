### Abstract
"I have put together many a file for this app, and I intend to get this baby working."-Me ten hours ago. The lady has jokes. I realize that I just used a FB template to create a card. I can code a Facebook profile. So, that's creepy. I used so many things to try to create the cards. I installed many things. I chatted with the local host, but the local host did not chat back.I looked through React Activity #24 like four days ago, and did coding SuperMarketSweep/Hoarders. I inspected(or studied) the code of the clicky game. I have no cards. I will have them some day. Thank you.
